# real-estate-
This project delivers a robust machine learning model for predicting house prices in Bangalore, India. Leveraging a Kaggle dataset, the model is built through a comprehensive data science pipeline that includes extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal to ensure data quality.

Multiple regression algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest were systematically evaluated using GridSearchCV to select the most accurate model. The final, optimized model is saved as a .pickle file for easy reuse.

A simple Python script (predictor.py) loads this trained model, allowing users to get instant and reliable price predictions by inputting a property's location, total square feet, BHK, and number of bathrooms. The project utilizes key Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to provide an end-to-end solution for real estate valuation.
